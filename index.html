                Depending on where you live, you may be in a various level of self-isolation.
                 Regardless of what your current schedule is like, it should be priority to 
                 keep your physical and mental health up right now. Here are five things that
                  might be killing your health in quarantine — and how to fix them.
            </p>

            Move Your Body
       </header>
            <p>
                When the greatest distance you have to travel in a day is from your bedroom to the
                 kitchen, a sedentary lifestyle can be easy to adapt during quarantine. It is also
                  one of the very worst things you can do for yourself! Make sure to move your body
                   every day. Whether it is a walk outside, a home workout (there are tons of free 
                   ones right now on Youtube and various fitness apps), or chasing your kids around 
                   the backyard, just make sure to get UP and MOVING!.
            </p>

                Being inactive can have many 
                   short-term negative effects (moodiness, depression, weight gain) as well as long
                   -term implications such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.

            Eat Fresh Foods
        </header>
                <p>
                    Processed foods can seem like the quick or simple solution for a meal,
                     but they are often laden with unnecessary ingredients and chemicals 
                     and high in sugar and salt. Come up with some meal ideas and make a 
                     grocery list before you go to the store or order your groceries. With 
                     a bit of planning, you can make an inexpensive quick and tasty dinner 
                     in very little time. Staples like beans (canned or dried), leafy greens,
                      fresh vegetable, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil and avocados
                       can come together quickly. Use different flavors like garlic, fresh herbs,
                        lemon juice or vinegar to create different flavor profiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Even the smallest changes in your routine can have a big impact on your health.
                        Take starting your day with lemon water, for instance.
                        Due to its high vitamin C levels, flavonoid content,
                        and acidity, drinking lemon water may have several health benefits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When stuck at home it’s easy to open another bottle of wine or find time
                     for that happy hour cocktail regularly. While it’s ok to indulge in that 
                     occasional drink, creating a regular habit of alcohol consumption can 
                    result in weight gain, depression, and poor sleep. As you know I actually 
                    believe that alcohol can be healthy! But the dose matters.

                </p>
                    <p>
                        So what the dose if you are a woman, stick to less than 5 drinks a week.
                         If you have already started the habit of daily drinking, try replacing
                          your cocktail with an iced tea or make a spritzer with sparkling water 
                          and a squeeze of citrus juice.

            Self-isolation doesn’t need to mean social-isolation. While certain areas
             are still on lockdown, you can still virtually connect with your friends 
             and family. Plan a Zoom game night, check in on your friends – especially
              those self-isolating alone, meet a friend for a walk outside if you’re 
              comfortable. Even alone, we don’t need to be alone.

                Follow Your Circadian Rhythm
            </header>
        <p>
            Eating late and waking up late can both become easy habits to fall into when 
            you don’t need to be at the office at a designated time or have a set schedule.
             Listen to your circadian rhythm and follow the movement of the sun. It may seem
              counter-intuitive, but waking up earlier will actually help you feel better and
               well-rested. Just make sure you are also going to bed at a decent time,
                and turning off those blue lights (phones, computers, etc.) at least 30 minutes
                 before bed, although ideally 90 minutes.
        </p>
            <p>
                Try to curb those late night snack sessions. Boredom makes it easy to do,
                 but snacking late is one of the worst things you can do for yourself if 
                 you are trying to lose or maintain weight. As you may know from my other 
                 articles, I believe that circadian fasting(stopping food 2-3 hours before
                  bed then not eating for 12-16 hours) is one of the most healing activities
                   you can do for your gut, hormones and brain.

                    We are living in a pandemic. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to your body.
                     Our schedules are completely flipped upside down and it can be easy to
                      adapt to bad habits, but by actively making healthy decisions, we will
                       feel better both physically, mentally, and emotionally.
